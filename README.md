# Software Development Track

## Overview

This repository contains projects and tasks completed as part of the Software Development Track (SD). Below are the tasks completed along with a brief description of each project.

## Tasks

### Task-01: Temperature Converter

Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the converted values to the user.

### Task-02: Guessing Game

Build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program prompts the user to input their guess, compares it to the generated number, and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It continues until the user correctly guesses the number and then displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.

### Task-03: Simple Contact Management System

Develop a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program provides options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It also allows users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts if needed. The program stores the contacts in memory or in a file for persistent storage.

### Task-04: Sudoku Solver

Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and uses an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers. It uses backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program displays the completed Sudoku grid.

### Task-05: Web Scraping

Create a program that extracts product information, such as names, prices, and ratings, from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a structured format like a CSV file. You are free to choose the website you scrape from.
